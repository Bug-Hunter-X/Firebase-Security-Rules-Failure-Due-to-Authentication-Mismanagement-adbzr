# Firebase Security Rules Failure Due to Authentication Mismanagement

This repository demonstrates a scenario where Firebase security rules appear to be failing, even though they are correctly configured.  The root cause is an issue within the authentication state management of the application.

## Problem
The provided code snippets illustrate a common problem: An attempt to access data, correctly permitted by the Firebase Security Rules, results in a permission denied error. This is not a problem with the rules themselves, but with the application's ability to correctly authenticate the user and reflect that state in all data access attempts.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that all data access attempts happen after the authentication state is reliably determined and reflects the current user's status. This requires robust error handling and state management.

## How to Reproduce
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and configure security rules.
3.  Run the application.
4.  Observe the behavior as described in the `bug.js` file.
5.  Review the solution provided in `bugSolution.js`.
