The solution addresses the authentication issue by ensuring that data access attempts are delayed until authentication is fully resolved and handled appropriately.  This typically involves using promises or async/await.

```javascript
// Correctly managing authentication state for data access
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(async user => {
if (user) {
  console.log('User is signed in:', user);
  try {
    const userData = await db.ref('users/' + user.uid).once('value').then(snapshot => snapshot.val());
    console.log(userData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error accessing data:', error);
  }
} else {
  console.log('User is signed out.');
  window.location.href = '/login';
}
});
```
This revised code ensures that the data access only happens after a successful authentication.  The `async/await` pattern provides better readability and error handling. The use of `user.uid` further ensures that the correct user ID is utilized.
